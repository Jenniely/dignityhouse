            <h2 class="chapter-header">Our Purpose</h2>
            <p class="chapter-text">Dignity House exists to provide housing and support for retirement-aged parolees.</p>

            <p class="chapter-text">There are approximately 35,000 men released on parole in Texas every year. TDCJ’s general hope for most of these parolees is that they parole to a family member’s house. This is more likely to happen when the offender is younger, and when their term in prison was shorter. Older men who serve decades in prison more often do not have family to parole to when their time comes – and the State does not take responsibility for housing these men.</p>
                
            <p class="chapter-text">Even when a parolee has financial ability to pay for his own housing, Parole stipulates that a new parolee may not parole to an empty residence. They must parole to an existing, occupied residence or halfway house.</p>
                
            <p class="chapter-text">The halfway houses that do exist are privately operated and are insufficient to meet the demand. Many that do exist have the aim of putting the men through substance abuse classes, job training, Christian discipleship programs, etc., and they target working aged men. Yet thousands of older parolees each year cannot find decent places to go to.</p>
                
            <p class="chapter-text">Dignity House aims to provide clean, decent “dignified” living for older parolees who simply need a place to be – a place to spend their retirement years. We are prepared to help these men get their identification in order, bank accounts open, etc., but we are not heavily 'programmatic'.</p>
                
            <p class="chapter-text">While we are a Christian organization, and we do offer some spiritual counseling and services, these are voluntary. Most of the men that come to us have spent a minimum of 20 years in prison, and are over the age of 65. We are not trying to get these men into the workforce, and we are not even trying to “reform” them. We do require that an applicant express remorse for his past crimes, and express a commitment to never returning to such activities. We also do have certain accountability requirements.

            <div class="story">
                <p class="chapter-text">The founder, Tom Regan, is a convicted felon himself who spent over 18 years in prison.</p>
                <p class="chapter-text">Tom’s backstory is that at age 32, married with children, he found himself in a financial crisis, and was greatly distressed about his family becoming homeless. In his desperation he committed crime, including burglary. He was then caught in a burglary and sentenced to probation. After this, Tom committed no further crimes.</p>
                <p class="chapter-text">However, shortly after being placed on probation, the business that Tom had burglarized was robbed. This person used the same method of entry as Tom, but he did so when the business was open, and he committed armed robbery. This degree of felony is something Tom avows he never did, and he had nothing to do with this robbery. The robber himself got away, but two months later Tom was charged with the robbery.</p>
                <p class="chapter-text">The case had no physical or other evidence, and came down to witness identification vs. Tom’s alibi. A trial ensued, and Tom lost, and he was sentenced to 35 years in prison. He then lost his appeals. Tom then served the minimum of 17.5 years, was then granted parole, and was actually released after a total of 18 years, 2 months, and 9 days.</p>
                <p class="chapter-text">During Tom’s time in prison he first got right with God. He came to accept that no excuse justified his turn to crime, and that although he was in prison for a crime he did not commit, he deserved no one’s sympathy. With this disposition Tom then used his time to improve himself in every way he could, including physical fitness, education, jobs skills, and, most importantly, spiritually.</p>
                <p class="chapter-text">Tom became a model inmate, and by the end of Tom’s time in prison he was an Outside Trustee, working as a clerk doing accounting work for the Regional Maintenance Office, and had a very good reputation among both staff and inmates.</p>
                <p class="chapter-text">He was released from prison at age 50 with $50 to his name, bad teeth, one set of poorly fitting clothes, and no ID. Not having any family support, he went to a homeless shelter.</p>
                <p class="chapter-text">Fortunately, he was able to find a job his first day out, working at a warehouse for $10 an hour. Being highly motivated, he immediately began to take steps to improve his future. Within a year he was happily married and working a new job at a door company, and within two more years he started his own company – Castle Doors and More, in Spring, Texas.</p>
                <p class="chapter-text">Castle Doors is a retail store that sells exterior, residential doors to area homeowners. This line of work capitalized on Tom’s background in residential remodeling and in sales. Today Castle Doors is a thriving business that sells over $1 million dollars a year, and which has a 4.9 Google Review Rating.</p>
                <p class="chapter-text">Tom is also now a faithful church member with his wife, and he also teaches a faith-based class in a couple of area prisons. Tom’s motivation for his prison ministry, including Dignity House Foundation, is based on 2 Corinthians 1:3-4, which reads:</p>
                <p class="chapter-text quote">“3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, 4 who comforts us in all our affliction so that we will be able to comfort those who are in any affliction with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.”</p>
                <p class="chapter-text">It was about ten years into Tom’s incarceration that this verse spoke to him, as he felt that God was preparing him for a future of working in prison ministry.</p>
                <p class="chapter-text">Today Tom will tell you he feels blessed beyond measure, yet he is still highly motivated to make up for lost years, and to fulfill his calling.
